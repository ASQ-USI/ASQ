  abstract = {JavaScript has been growing from a language for embedding simple scripts into Web pages to a language for programming complex Web applications, whose logic is deployed across both Web browsers and Web servers. Current software packaging mechanisms for JavaScript enable a basic level of modularity and reuse. However, they have not yet reached full maturity in terms of enabling to extend a system with features contributed as third-party plugins, while encapsulating them adequately.
In this paper we present a novel plugin system for JavaScript applications, which integrate Node.js modules with HTML5 Web Components. It provides abstractions for: real time and loosely coupled communication between front-end and back-end components, persistent state storage, and isomorphic usage of JavaScript. Plugins can use hooks and events to contribute functionality and embed it into the main application flow, while respecting the common asynchronous non-blocking programming paradigm of JavaScript. We demonstrate the expressiveness of the framework as it is used to build ASQ: an open and extensible educational Web platform.

  abstract = {Taking full advantage of the Web technology platform dur- ing in-class lectures requires a shift from the established scheme of online education delivery that utilizes the video channel to embed all types of content and gathers student feedback via multiple choice questions or textual answers. In this paper we present the design of ASQ to deliver interactive content for use in heterogeneous educational settings with a large number of students, taking advantage of the co-location of students and instructors and building upon the latest capabilities of the Web platform. ASQ is centered around interactive HTML5 presentations coupled with a versatile microformat to create and deliver various types quizzes and scalable, synchronous/asynchronous feedback mechanisms.},

  abstract = {ASQ is a Web application for creating and delivering interactive HTML5 presentations. It is designed to support teachers that need to gather real-time feedback from the students while delivering their lectures. Presentation slides are delivered to viewers that can answer the questions embedded in the slides. The objective is to maximize the efficiency of bi-directional communication between the lecturer and a large audience. More specifically, in the context of a hybrid MOOC classroom, a teacher can use ASQ to get feedback in real time about the level of comprehension of the presented material while reducing the time for gathering survey data, monitoring attendance and assessing solutions.},
