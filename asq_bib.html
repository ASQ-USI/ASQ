  abstract = {Modern constructivist approaches to education dictate active experimentation with the study material and have been linked with improved learning outcomes in STEM fields. During classroom time we believe it is important for students to experiment with the lecture material since active recall helps them to start the memory encoding process as well as to catch misconceptions early and to prevent them from taking root. In this paper, we report on our experiences using ASQ, a Web-based interactive presentation tool in a functional and logic programming course taught at the Faculty of Informatics and Information Technologies at the Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava. ASQ allowed us to collect immediate feedback from students and retain their attention by asking complex types of questions and aggregating student answers in real time. From our experience we identified several requirements and guidelines for successfully adopting ASQ. One of the most critical concerns was how to estimate the time when to stop collecting the students{\textquoteright} answers and proceed to their evaluation and discussion with the class. We also report the students{\textquoteright} feedback on the ASQ system that we collected in the form of the standard SUS questionnaire.

  abstract = {Digital devices (most often laptops and smartphones), though desired tools by students in a higher education classroom, have in the past been shown to serve more as distractors than supporters of learning. One of the reasons is the often undirected nature of the devices{\textquoteright} usage. With our work we aim to turn students{\textquoteright} digital devices into teaching and communication tools by seamlessly interleaving lecture material and complex questions in the students{\textquoteright} browser through ASQ, a Web application for broadcasting and tracking interactive presentations. ASQ{\textquoteright}s fine-grained logging abilities allow us to track second by second to what extent students are engaging with ASQ which in turn enables insights into student behaviour dynamics. This setup enables us to conduct {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}in situ{\textquoteright}{\textquoteright} experiments. Based on the logs collected in a longitudinal study over a ten week period across 14 lectures with more than 300 students, we investigate (i) to what extent ASQ can be reliably employed to assess attention and learning in the classroom, and (ii) whether different in-class question spacing strategies impact student learning and engagement.},

  abstract = {ASQ is a Web application for broadcasting and tracking interactive presentations, which can be used to support active learning pedagogies during lectures, labs and exercise sessions. Students connect their smartphones, tablets or laptops to receive the current slide as it is being explained by the teacher. Slides can include interactive teaching elements (usually questions of different forms). In contrast to other existing platforms, ASQ does not only collect, aggregate and visualize the answers in real-time, it also supports the data analytics in the classroom paradigm by providing the teacher with a real-time analysis of student behaviour during the entire session. One vital aspect of student behaviour is (in)attention and in this paper we discuss how we infer --- in real-time --- student attention based on log traces ASQ collects.},

  abstract = {JavaScript has been growing from a language for embedding simple scripts into Web pages to a language for programming complex Web applications, whose logic is deployed across both Web browsers and Web servers. Current software packaging mechanisms for JavaScript enable a basic level of modularity and reuse. However, they have not yet reached full maturity in terms of enabling to extend a system with features contributed as third-party plugins, while encapsulating them adequately.
In this paper we present a novel plugin system for JavaScript applications, which integrate Node.js modules with HTML5 Web Components. It provides abstractions for: real time and loosely coupled communication between front-end and back-end components, persistent state storage, and isomorphic usage of JavaScript. Plugins can use hooks and events to contribute functionality and embed it into the main application flow, while respecting the common asynchronous non-blocking programming paradigm of JavaScript. We demonstrate the expressiveness of the framework as it is used to build ASQ: an open and extensible educational Web platform.

ASQ is centered around interactive HTML5 presentations coupled with a versatile microformat to create and deliver various types quizzes and scalable, synchronous/asynchronous feedback mechanisms.},
