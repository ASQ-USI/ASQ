ASQ
===
ASQ aims to increase teacher awareness and student engagement in traditional brick-and-mortar classrooms by taking advantage of the latest Web technologies.
With ASQ teachers broadcast a Web-based slideshow synchronously to all students. They can pose [many types](https://github.com/ASQ-USI-Elements) of questions, track the students answering them, filter and discuss answers in real time.

About The Name
--------------

ASQ stands for Answer, Slide, Question.
The core concept of this app is a **S**lide that contains one or more **Q**uestion(s) for which the audience submits solutions and finaly the correct **A**nswer is displayed.
The three initials: S, Q, A can be reordered give ASQ (many thanks to Max for the idea!).
