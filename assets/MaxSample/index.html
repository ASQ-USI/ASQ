			The `id` attribute of the step element is used to identify it in the URL, but it's optional.
			If it is not defined, it will get a default value of `step-N` where N is a number of slide.

			So in the example below it'll be `step-2`.

			The hash part of the url when this step is active will be `#/step-2`.

			You can also use `#step-2` in a link, to point directly to this particular step.

			Please note, that while `#/step-2` (with slash) would also work in a link it's not recommended.
			Using classic `id`-based links like `#step-2` makes these links usable also in fallback mode.

			This is an example of step element being scaled.

			Again, we use a `data-` attribute, this time it's `data-scale="4"`, so it means that this
			element will be 4 times larger than the others.
			From presentation and transitions point of view it means, that it will have to be scaled
			down (4 times) to make it back to it's correct size.

			This element introduces rotation.

			Notation shouldn't be a surprise. We use `data-rotate="90"` attribute, meaning that this
			element should be rotated by 90 degrees clockwise.

					It's a <strong>presentation tool</strong>

				</p>
			</div>

			<!--

			And now it gets really exiting! We move into third dimension!

			Along with `data-x` and `data-y`, you can define the position on third (Z) axis, with
			`data-z`. In the example below we use `data-z="-3000"` meaning that element should be
			positioned far away from us (by 3000px).

			-->
			<div id="tiny" class="step" data-x="2825" data-y="2325" data-z="-3000" data-rotate="300" data-scale="1">
				<p>
					and <b>tiny</b> ideas
				</p>
			</div>

			<!--

			This step here doesn't introduce anything new when it comes to data attributes, but you
			should notice in the demo that some words of this text are being animated.
			It's a very basic CSS transition that is applied to the elements when this step element is
			reached.

			At the very beginning of the presentation all step elements are given the class of `future`.
			It means that they haven't been visited yet.

			When the presentation moves to given step `future` is changed to `present` class name.
			That's how animation on this step works - text moves when the step has `present` class.

			Finally when the step is left the `present` class is removed from the element and `past`
			class is added.

			So basically every step element has one of three classes: `future`, `present` and `past`.
			Only one current step has the `present` class.

			<!--

			And the last one shows full power and flexibility of impress.js.

			You can not only position element in 3D, but also rotate it around any axis.
			So this one here will get rotated by -40 degrees (40 degrees anticlockwise) around X axis and
			10 degrees (clockwise) around Y axis.

			You can of course rotate it around Z axis with `data-rotate-z` - it has exactly the same effect
			as `data-rotate` (these two are basically aliases).

			-->

			<!--

			So to make a summary of all the possible attributes used to position presentation steps, we have:

			* `data-x`, `data-y`, `data-z` - they define the position of **the center** of step element on
			the canvas in pixels; their default value is 0;
			* `data-rotate-x`, `data-rotate-y`, 'data-rotate-z`, `data-rotate` - they define the rotation of
			the element around given axis in degrees; their default value is 0; `data-rotate` and `data-rotate-z`
			are exactly the same;
			* `data-scale` - defines the scale of step element; default value is 1

			These values are used by impress.js in CSS transformation functions, so for more information consult
			CSS transfrom docs: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/transform

		Hint is not related to impress.js in any way.

		But it can show you how to use impress.js features in creative way.

		When the presentation step is shown (selected) its element gets the class of "active" and the body element
		gets the class based on active step id `impress-on-ID` (where ID is the step's id)... It may not be
		so clear because of all these "ids" in previous sentence, so for example when the first step (the one with
		the id of `bored`) is active, body element gets a class of `impress-on-bored`.

		This class is used by this hint below. Check CSS file to see how it's shown with delayed CSS animation when
		the first step of presentation is visible for a couple of seconds.

		...

		And when it comes to this piece of JavaScript below ... kids, don't do this at home ;)
		It's just a quick and dirty workaround to get different hint text for touch devices.
		In a real world it should be at least placed in separate JS file ... and the touch content should be
		probably just hidden somewhere in HTML - not hard-coded in the script.

		Just sayin' ;)

		-->
		<div class="hint">
			<p>
				Use a spacebar or arrow keys to navigate
			</p>
		</div>
		<script>
			if ("ontouchstart" in document.documentElement) {
				document.querySelector(".hint").innerHTML = "<p>Tap on the left or right to navigate</p>";
			}
		</script>

		<!--

		Last, but not least.

		To make all described above really work, you need to include impress.js in the page.
		I strongly encourage to minify it first.

		In here I just include full source of the script to make it more readable.

		You also need to call a `impress().init()` function to initialize impress.js presentation.
		And you should do it in the end of your document. Not only because it's a good practice, but also
		because it should be done when the whole document is ready.
		Of course you can wrap it in any kind of "DOM ready" event, but I was too lazy to do so ;)

			impress().init();
